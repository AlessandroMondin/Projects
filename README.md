## A personal implementation of YOLOv5(m)

The scope of this repository is to facilitate the understanding of YOLOv5 and was a great opportunity to improve my knowledge as well. The sources I used while implementating are Ultralytics <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5" target="_blank">YOLOv5</a> for the architecture details and Aladdin Persson <a href="https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/object_detection/YOLOv3" target="_blank">YOLOv3</a> for training-pipeline design.

Instruction for use:
<pre>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/AlessandroMondin/YOLOV5m.git
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> YOLOv5m
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
